 <h1 style="font-size:250%;" ><b>About</b></h1>
 <p1>As stated I am currently studying at Fleming College Frost Campus which is situated in Lindsay. I definatly wish I could have had a chance
 to study on the Frost Campus but it was decided that the course would be done fully remote.</p1>
 <p2> I was origionally a fourth year Archaeology student at Trent University situated in Peterborough. I was able to do almost 2 full years on 
  campus before we had to shift to online learning. </p2>
