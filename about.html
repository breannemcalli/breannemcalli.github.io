 <h1 style="font-size:250%;" ><b>About Me!</b></h1>
 <p1 style="font-size:150%;">As stated I am currently studying at Fleming College Frost Campus which is situated in Lindsay.<br> I definatly wish I could have had a chance
 to study on the Frost Campus but it was decided that the course would be done fully remote.</p1>
 <p2 style="font-size:150%;"> I was origionally a fourth year Archaeology student at Trent University situated in Peterborough. <br> I was able to do almost 2 full years on 
  campus before we had to shift to online learning. However, when I was at Trent I was part of Lady Eaton College which is on of the five colleges found at Trent.<br>
  Being part of a College is almost like being in a little community of people who usually board in the same area.<br></p2>

  <p3 style="font-size:150%;"> <br> <br>Now to the thing that I am sure everyone wants to know....do I have any pets? The answer is yes I do! <br> His name is Logan and he is a 4 year old shih tzu bichon
   He loves to cuddle and he even enjoys sitting in on my classes.... or rather taking a nap on my bed while I am in class, but it is the thought that counts.<br> However if
  anyone has any questions about my best boy then I will gladly answer. <br> <br> </p3>

  <p4 style="font-size:150%;"> As much as I enjoy learning about archaeology and history, I do like most students enjoy a good vacation which in recent years <br> has been pretty
   hard to do. My family and I usually go camping multiple times a year during the summer when I can actually relax. I took this photo of my dog Logan, the <br> first time we 
   took him to beach. He didn't hate it but I think he was confused at why my dad and my sister were "putting themselves in danger" by going further into the water. <br> 
   He enjoys it now but he really hates the sand when his paws are wet. <br> </p4>

 <p5 style="font-size:150%;"> On top of spending time with my family, I also spend a lot of time with my friends
