  <!-- second heading about my school experience -->
 <h2 style="font-size:150%;" ><b> <i>School Experience</i></b></h2>
 <!-- This paragraph explains my school experience  -->
 <p>As stated I am currently studying at Fleming College Frost Campus which is situated in Lindsay.<br> I definatly wish I could have had a chance
 to study on the Frost Campus but it was decided that the course would be done fully remote.</p>
  
 <p> I was origionally a fourth year Archaeology student at Trent University situated in Peterborough. <br> I was able to do almost 2 full years on 
  campus before we had to shift to online learning. However, when I was at Trent I was part of Lady Eaton College which is on of the five colleges found at Trent.<br>
  Being part of a College is almost like being in a little community of people who usually board in the same area.<br></p>

 <!-- A paragraph about my dog -->
 <h3 style="font-size:150%;" ><b><i>Fuzzy Friend</i></b></h3>

   <p><br>Now to the thing that I am sure everyone wants to know....do I have any pets? The answer is yes I do! <br> His name is Logan and he is a 4 year old shih tzu bichon
   He loves to cuddle and he even enjoys sitting in on my classes.... or rather taking a nap on my bed while I am in class, but it is the thought that counts.<br> However if
  anyone has any questions about my best boy then I will gladly answer. <br>  </p>

 <!-- Heading about questions people usually ask about my major -->
 <h4 style="font-size:150%;" ><b><i>Questions about my Major</i></b></h4>
 
 <!-- This is the answers to the questions -->
  <p> The main question I get asked as an Archaeology Major is why did you decide to go into archaeology? <br>
   The answer is really quite simple, the reason I decided to go into archaeology was because I really wanted to be a 
   Paleontologist since I was a kid. <br> I realized that I should go into a more broad major and then narow down my focus to either 
   Biological archaeology or paleontology by my fourth year.<br> </p>
  
  <!-- This is heading is about my Travels -->
 <h5 style="font-size:150%;" ><b><i><br>Travels</i></b></h5>
 <!-- This is paragraph outlines my travel experience -->
 <p> On top of spending time with my family, I also spend a lot of time with my friends, I also love to travel. I have traveled to multiple countries <br> 
  and I have got to say that my favourite country to visit by far is France. I went on a trip back in 2017 with my high school history program to celebrate the 100 year 
  anniversary <br> of the battle at Vimy Ridge. It was one of the coolest experiences I have ever ghad and I would totally go back. <br> </p>
