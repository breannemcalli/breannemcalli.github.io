  <!-- second heading about my school experience -->
 <h2  ><b> <i>School Experience</i></b></h2>
 <!-- This paragraph explains my school experience  -->
 <p>As stated I am currently studying at Fleming College Frost Campus which is situated in Lindsay.<br> I definatly wish I could have had a chance
 to study on the Frost Campus but it was decided that the course would be done fully remote.</p>
  
 <p> I was origionally a fourth year Archaeology student at Trent University situated in Peterborough. <br> I was able to do almost 2 full years on 
  campus before we had to shift to online learning. However, when I was at Trent I was part of Lady Eaton College which is on of the five colleges found at Trent.<br>
  Being part of a College is almost like being in a little community of people who usually board in the same area.<br></p>

 <!-- A paragraph about my dog -->
 <h3><b><i>Fuzzy Friend</i></b></h3>

   <p><br>Now to the thing that I am sure everyone wants to know....do I have any pets? The answer is yes I do! <br> His name is Logan and he is a 4 year old shih tzu bichon.
   He loves to cuddle and he even enjoys sitting in on my classes.... or rather taking a nap on my bed while I am in class, but it is the thought that counts.<br> However if
  anyone has any questions about my best boy then I will gladly answer. <br>  </p>

 <h4><b><i> My Skills </i></b></h4>
 <p> Honestly I never know what to put when people ask me my skills, so I will answer with things I believe to be important.
  To start I believe that the most importnat resource to any project or team is someone who is able to think on their feet to solve 
  a problem. I have taken many courses over the years where group projects were extremely important and I always took on the probelm solver role.<br>
  This role fits extremely well with my personality, as I am easy to get along with, comunicate with and I am always open to trying every 
  possible idea, my own or someone elses. I like to keep things organized which is an extremely helpful skill to have not only in a 
  group setting but also an individual setting. <br>
  I am relatively out-going which usually makes people feel more comfoartable with me and as a result we are able to communicate more freely then we would <br>
  if they felt as though I was cold and unapproachable. Overall, I enjoy working with other people more than alone because I tend to understand and learn more in an <br>
  interactive group setting.</p>
 
 <!-- Heading about questions people usually ask about my major -->
 <h5><b><i>Questions about my Major</i></b></h5>
 
 <!-- This is the answers to the questions -->
  <p> The main question I get asked as an Archaeology Major is why did you decide to go into archaeology? <br>
   The answer is really quite simple, the reason I decided to go into archaeology was because I really wanted to be a 
   Paleontologist since I was a kid. <br> I realized that I should go into a more broad major and then narow down my focus to either 
   Biological archaeology or paleontology by my fourth year.<br> </p>
  
  <!-- This is heading is about my Travels -->
 <h6><b><i><br>Travels</i></b></h6>
 <!-- This is paragraph outlines my travel experience -->
 <p> On top of spending time with my family, I also spend a lot of time with my friends, I also love to travel. I have traveled to multiple countries <br> 
  and I have got to say that my favourite country to visit by far is France. I went on a trip back in 2017 with my high school history program to celebrate the 100 year 
  anniversary <br> of the battle at Vimy Ridge. It was one of the coolest experiences I have ever had and I would totally go back.
  The photo on the right was taken by me, in downtown London, England on our way to rise the London Eye. The photo on the left showcases part of Dover Castle which
  was the first placed we stopped at after riding the ferry from France to the White Cliffs of Dover. <br> </p>
