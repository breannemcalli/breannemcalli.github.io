 <h1 style="font-size:250%;" ><b>About Me!</b></h1>
 <p1 style="font-size:150%;">As stated I am currently studying at Fleming College Frost Campus which is situated in Lindsay.<br> I definatly wish I could have had a chance
 to study on the Frost Campus but it was decided that the course would be done fully remote.</p1>
 <p2 style="font-size:150%;"> I was origionally a fourth year Archaeology student at Trent University situated in Peterborough. <br> I was able to do almost 2 full years on 
  campus before we had to shift to online learning. However, when I was at Trent I was part of Lady Eaton College which is on of the five colleges found at Trent.<br>
  Being part of a College is almost like being in a little community of people who usually board in the same area.<br><br></p2>

  <p3 style="font-size:150%;"> <br> <br>Now to the thing that I am sure everyone wants to know....do I have any pets? The answer is yes I do! <br> His name is Logan and he is a 4 year old shih tzu bichon
   He loves to cuddle and he even enjoys sitting in on my classes.... or rather taking a nap on my bed while I am in class, but it is the thought that counts.<br> However if
  anyone has any questions about my best boy then I will gladly answer. <br> <br> </p3>

  <p4 style="font-size:150%;"> <br> <br>The main question I get asked as an Archaeology Major is why did you decide to go into archaeology? <br>
   The answer is really quite simple, the reason I decided to go into archaeology was because I really wanted to be a 
   Paleontologist since I was a kid. <br> I realized that I should go into a more broad major and then narow down my focus to either 
   Biological archaeology or paleontology by my fourth year.<br> </p4>
