<p1>Welcome, My name is Breanne McAllister! I am currently studying at Fleming College for Geographical Information Systems in the Application specialist branch.</p1>
  <p2>I started my academic journey at Trent University where I am in the process of getting my Bachelors of Science degree with a focus on Achaeology. <br> 
  I decided to go to Trent over other Universities not only because the campus is super pretty but because I was actually born in <br>
  Peterbprough and my dad actually went and graduated from Trent when I was a baby. Trent has great undergraduate programs and the staff <br>
  there are amazing!<br><br><br><br></p2>
