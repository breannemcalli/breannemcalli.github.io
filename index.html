 <h2><b><i>A Little Background Information about Me</i></b></h2>
<p>Welcome, My name is Breanne McAllister! I am currently studying at Fleming College for Geographical Information Systems in the Application specialist branch.
 I started my academic journey at Trent University where I am in the process of getting my Bachelors of Science degree with a focus on Achaeology. <br> 
 I decided to go to Trent over other Universities not only because the campus is super pretty but because I was actually born in <br>
 Peterborough and when I went to visit the campus I absolutly fell in love with it. It has been almost four years since then and it feels like yersterday
   that I started this journey. <br>Check out the link below for more information on Trent University. <br></p>

 <h2><b><i>A Photo of Me</i></b></h2>
 <!-- Second paragraph with a description of my picture shown below -->
  <p> I honestly can say that I do not take many photos of my self so here is a photo from my <br>
   prom back in 2018. I look pretty much the exact same, I am the one in the middle who looks like she is <br>
   done taking photos for the night,which I totally was. </p>
