 <h2 style="font-size:150%;"><b>A Little Background Information about Me</b></h2>
<p1>Welcome, My name is Breanne McAllister! I am currently studying at Fleming College for Geographical Information Systems in the Application specialist branch.</p1>
  <p2>I started my academic journey at Trent University where I am in the process of getting my Bachelors of Science degree with a focus on Achaeology. <br> 
  I decided to go to Trent over other Universities not only because the campus is super pretty but because I was actually born in <br>
  Peterborough and my dad actually went and graduated from Trent when I was a baby. Trent has great undergraduate programs and the staff <br>
  there are amazing!<br></p2>

 <h2 style="font-size:150%;" ><i>A Photo of Me</i></h2>
  <p3 style="font-style:150%;"> I honestly can say that I do not take many photos of my self so here is a photo from my <br>
   grad 12 graduation back in 2018. I look pretty much the exact same, I am the one in the middle who looks like she is <br>
   done taking photos for the night. (which she was)
